    <p> CustomPic <br> Made by Farah Iqbal in 2021. <br> This project is my implementation of custom camera where you can edit the design of the webcam by adding different filters. The user can pick form 3 filters that p5.js provided, which are THRESHOLD, GRAY, and INVERT. These can be added to the webcam by typing the letters, 't','g', and 'i' repectively. The user can also add more filters like a pixelized design by typing in the letter 'p'. They can also type in 'w' to get some text to pop up on the webcam. If they type in 'h', then they can have some hearts pictures pop up on the corners of the webcam and similarly if the user types in 'f', then they can have some flower pictures pop up in the corner of the webcam. The user can also have a choice to change the color tint of their webcam for more customization. The user can do this by clicking on the right arrow key on their keyboard. This will cause the webcam tint to change to random colors and the user can stop clicking the right arrow key when they find the color the like. Once the user has their final design of the webcam, whenever they are ready, they can take their custom picture! They can do this by clicking on the 'Take Pic!' button to the right of the screen, once they do this, a popup will show up on the screen where they can save their newly created picture on their local computer! <br> I was inspired by the phone app of Snapchat. I always like the idea of taking pictures and adding fun filters and sharing them with my friends! I thought it would be really cool to create my own version using the skills that I learned in class! I also really liked learning about using the webcam during class and I wanted to explore more into what I could do with the webcam to make it more interactive and visually pleasing. I wanted my project to be a tool that people can use to express their creativity, have fun with, and also get to explore the different functionalities of the webcam. </p>
